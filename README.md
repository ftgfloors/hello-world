# hello-world
Serving as my entrance into the world of coding, this repo is elementary at best in its content but facilities learning along my journey

I have decided to get into coding after noticing so many occasions on which having an intermediate-level understanding of programming would have been very beneficial.  I have some, although limited, experience with HTML4 and Javascript, along with a very, very basic knowledge of Java and C++.  Since the project management software I use most often is written in Java, I thought it would be a great place to start, though I do find myself playing around with other languages simultaneously as time allows.
